Case:
VerdeVista   Market (VVM)   is a   premium food   retailer, featuring up-market, organic, and   locally sourced   products. One of their recently acquired suppliers,   Mama Jen’s,   is a   local strawberry and   blueberry farm, supplying VVM with a   premium   branded 150ml jars of hand-made organic strawberry   jams.
One of the selection criteria that   Mama Jen’s had to   meet was   the   consistency   of the fill volume of each jar of   jam. VVM will not tolerate   inaccurate or highly variable fill   rates in their product. As part   of the   entry   requirements,   Mama Jen’s   had to submit three descriptive   measurements from a random sample of 200   random jars   of their   150ml strawberry   jams. 
a.    which three descriptive   measurements would VVM have   asked for from   Mama   Jen’s for such evaluation? Justify your suggestions by explaining why VVM would choose each   measurement.
b.    The sample fill volume data from the   200   random jars of   150ml strawberry
jams are stored   in another file.   Use   Excel to generate the three descriptive measurements   nominated   in part a. Verify your calculations using   R Studio. State the values of the three measurements and upload files   containing your   workings and outputs on   Excel and   R Studio as   part of your   submission. 
c.      In VVM’s   perspective, evaluate all three descriptive   measurements for the
purpose of supplier selection (based on   information   in the case).   For each   of   the three measurements, suggest and   briefly explain one   limitation   in   its   use   for VVM’s purpose.

VVM wants to finalise the agreement to   partner with   Mama Jen’s.   代 写Data analysisPython
代做程序编程语言Before doing so,   it   wants to   more   rigourously review Mama Jen’s fill accuracy   performance   by   using hypothesis testing,   hoping to get   results with an   indication of the associated significance and confidence   level.   Help VVM by carrying out the following   steps   and   answering the questions. 
a.      Define the null and alternative   hypotheses for a suitable   hypothesis test.
b.      list all relevant “ingredients”   required for this hypothesis   test.   Use   the   data   in   the   .csv file to generate their values   if necessary. You   may use   Excel or   R to   do this.   No submission of evidence of workings required for this   part.
c.      Calculate and report the values of the   upper and   lower non-rejection   limits.   Clearly lay out all steps   involved   in the workings to   get full   marks.
d.      Carry out the hypothesis test   by using the outputs from   part   c.   State   the      resulting conclusion (reject or not   reject) with justification in your   answer.
e.      In   natural   language, describe what the conclusion from   part d means for
VVM’s decision.   Using the   information available, describe the likelihood that   the conclusion from the   hypothesis test   being erroneous (presuming that all   your   calculations   are   correct).
